# ESPgenlasso (Exact Solution Path of generanlized lasso problem for rank-deficient design matrices)
This R package provides a solution path of generalized lasso problem for rank-deficient design matrices, which is an exact entrie solution path, as described in the following paper:

- Jaesung Hwang, Joongho Won, Yongdai Kim, Characterization of the Solutions Set of the Generalized Lasso for Rank-deficient Design Matrices.

And when the Lasso penalty is contained in the penalty matrix, the specific solutions, which are the (partial) minimal (or/and) maximal $$l_1$$ norm solution and the (partial) $$l_{\infty}$$ norm solution, are obtained.
